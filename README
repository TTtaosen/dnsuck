A python script to detect DNS spoofing attacks. 

The tool sniffs the network and looks for DNS requests to DNS servers.
Then it detects if a certain request received multiple answers 
that are different from each other.

E.g. if a DNS request from 128.111.42.51 for www.google.com, with id 61172, to 128.111.1.1 (port 53) receives two different replies 
(say one answer replies that the name has IP addresses 74.125.19.99 and 74.125.19.104 while the other reply says that the name would be mapped to 128.111.48.69), 
the tool would output: 
  DETECT: REQ: 61172 NAM: www.google.com SRC: 128.111.42.51:15655 DST: 128.111.1.1:53 
  AN1: 74.125.19.99,74.125.19.104 AN2: 128.111.48.69
